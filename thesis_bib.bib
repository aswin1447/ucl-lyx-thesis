  Abstract                 = {A nonparametric kernel-based method for realizing Bayes' rule is proposed, based on representations of probabilities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Probabilities are uniquely characterized by the mean of the canonical map to the RKHS. The prior and conditional probabilities are expressed in terms of RKHS functions of an empirical sample: no explicit parametric model is needed for these quantities. The posterior is likewise an RKHS mean of a weighted sample. The estimator for the expectation of a function of the posterior is derived, and rates of consistency are shown. Some representative applications of the kernel Bayes' rule are presented, including Baysian computation without likelihood and filtering with a nonparametric state-space model.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract. Various noninformative prior distributions have been suggested for scale parameters in hierarchical models. We construct a new folded-noncentral-t family of conditionally conjugate priors for hierarchical standard deviation parameters, and then consider noninformative and weakly informative priors in this family. We use an example to illustrate serious problems with the inverse-gamma family of ânoninformative â prior distributions. We suggest instead to use a uniform prior on the hierarchical standard deviation, using the half-t family when the number of groups is small and in other settings where a weakly informative prior is desired. We also illustrate the use of the half-t family for hierarchical modeling of multiple variance parameters such as arise in the analysis of variance.},

  Abstract                 = {Generative models provide a powerful framework for probabilistic reasoning. However, in many domains their use has been hampered by the practical difficulties of inference. This is particularly the case in computer vision, where models of the imaging process tend to be large, loopy and layered. For this reason bottom-up conditional models have traditionally dominated in such domains. We find that widely-used, general-purpose message passing inference algorithms such as Expectation Propagation (EP) and Variational Message Passing (VMP) fail on the simplest of vision models. With these models in mind, we introduce a modification to message passing that learns to exploit their layered structure by passing 'consensus' messages that guide inference towards good solutions. Experiments on a variety of problems show that the proposed technique leads to significantly more accurate inference results, not only when compared to standard EP and VMP, but also when compared to competitive bottom-up conditional models.},

  Abstract                 = {``We won't comment here on the long history of the book, which is recounted in [E. L. Lehmann, Statist. Sci. 12 (1997), no. 1, 48--52; MR1466430], but shall use this Preface to indicate the principal changes from the second edition [E. L. Lehmann, Testing statistical hypotheses, Second edition, Wiley, New York, 1986; MR0852406 (87j:62001)]. ``The present volume is divided into two parts. Part I (Chapters 1--10) treats small-sample theory, while Part II (Chapters 11--15) treats large-sample theory. The preface to the second edition stated that `the most important omission is an adequate treatment of optimality paralleling that given for estimation in the companion volume [E. L. Lehmann and G. Casella, Theory of point estimation, Second edition, Springer, New York, 1998; MR1639875 (99g:62025)]'. We here remedy this failure by treating the difficult topic of asymptotic optimality (in Chapter 13) together with the large-sample tools needed for this purpose (in Chapters 11 and 12). Having developed these tools, we use them in Chapter 14 to give a much fuller treatment of tests of goodness of fit than was possible in the second edition, and in Chapter 15 to provide an introduction to the bootstrap and related techniques. Various large-sample considerations that in the second edition were discussed in earlier chapters now have been moved to Chapter 11. ``Another major addition is a more comprehensive treatment of multiple testing including some recent optimality results. This topic is now presented in Chapter 9. In order to make room for these extensive additions, we had to eliminate some material found in the second edition, primarily the coverage of the multivariate linear hypothesis. ``Except for some of the basic results from Part I, a detailed knowledge of small-sample theory is not required for Part II. In particular, the necessary background should include: Chapter 3, Sections 3.1--3.5, 3.8--3.9; Chapter 4: Sections 4.1--4.4; Chapter 5, Sections 5.1--5.3; Chapter 6, Sections 6.1--6.2; Chapter 7, Sections 7.1--7.2; Chapter 8, Sections 8.1--8.2, 8.4--8.5.'' },

  Abstract                 = {In this letter, we provide a study of learning in a Hilbert space of vectorvalued functions. We motivate the need for extending learning theory of scalar-valued functions by practical considerations and establish some basic results for learning vector-valued functions that should prove useful in applications. Specifically, we allow an output space Y to be a Hilbert space, and we consider a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of functions whose values lie in Y. In this setting, we derive the form of the minimal norm interpolant to a finite set of data and apply it to study some regularization functionals that are important in learning theory. We consider specific examples of such functionals corresponding to multiple-output regularization networks and support vector machines, for both regression and classification. Finally, we provide classes of operator-valued kernels of the dot product and translation-invariant type.},

  Abstract                 = {A nonparametric approach for policy learning for POMDPs is proposed. The approach represents distributions over the states, observations, and actions as embeddings in feature spaces, which are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Distributions over states given the observations are obtained by applying the kernel Bayes' rule to these distribution embeddings. Policies and value functions are defined on the feature space over states, which leads to a feature space expression for the Bellman equation. Value iteration may then be used to estimate the optimal value function and associated policy. Experimental results confirm that the correct policy is learned using the feature space representation.},
